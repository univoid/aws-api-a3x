# Idea
We use Rekognition and S3 and Lambda  
We refer to [this site](https://recipe.kc-cloud.jp/archives/9110)  

First, we upload an picture to S3.  
Then, Lambda start to connect to Rekognition and recognize a person in the picture using Celebrity Recognition.
Rekognition returns JSON that includes the name of the person in the picture.  
Finnaly, we search news of the person with google, Yahoo, or other search engines, and we get a list of news titles and URLs.

## Notes of development process

### Preparation Phase
1. At first, we want it:
    ![original idea](pic/IMG2.jpeg)

2. But the document is not so readable for newbee, and there are too much complicated setting (not suitable for greenhand sometimes) and a lot of "Historical problem" which make the notes shared by other guys could not work well any long. Finally, we failed.

3. Then I turned to find out: Are there any Microframework to help us solve it? Luckily, we got it: [Chalice: Python Serverless Microframework for AWS](https://github.com/awslabs/chalice)

4. God bless us, it saved a bit of time to read the tedious offical document about how to setting the nobody-care things, just for a simple function, furthermore, I tried to implement our project based on [Freko: Serverless Face Detection API](https://github.com/gotokatsuya/freko)

### Reproduce and Verify the feasibility
1. Freko was built a year ago... So there maybe a lot of thing happened in AWS life-cycle. We need to Reproduce it onemore.

2. Just as worried, it could not works well. Unknown error came out, so that DEBUG is needed.

3. by a lot of trying, I pointed out the problem: the function of *base64.decodestring(data)* is too old, and after my rewrite it by *base64.b64decode(data)*, it worked.

4. And then, another BUG came out, we could not position the S3 we created.

5. Finally, I got that "Region resetting" is essential but I forgot it. Fixed this problem by updating initial config file simply.

6. Consequently, it worked as well as one year ago.

### Implement our own function
1. add function recognize_celebrity():
```
def rec_c(name):
    try:

        response = REKOGNITION.recognize_celebrities(
            Image={
                'S3Object': {
                    'Bucket': BUCKET,
                    'Name': name,
                }
            }
        )
        return response
    except Exception as ex:
        raise ChaliceViewError("fail to detect faces. error = " + str(type(ex))) 
```
Nothing happened but a Error message with nothing useful:

    {"Code": "InternalServerError", "Message": "An internal server error occurred."}

2. Long time Debuging....

3. learned from Chalice Document, turn on DEBUG-mode, and got the complete Error tracking, Finally, positioned the error: 
**the version of boto3(SDK) deployed in lambda is too old to support this API** 

4. So that I put the newest bot3 1.4.4 in the depolying package, updated the requirement.txt file. Consequently, it worked.

5. Successed in call API and got the response.


### Combine with Search module
implemented by @ogura

1. add function search_response(res):
```
    def search_response(res):
    # read name of the person in the picture from JSON
    ans = {}
    json_dict = res
    name = json_dict["CelebrityFaces"][0]["Name"]
    ans['Name'] = name
    # search with google custom search API
    api_key = 'AIzaSyB8aEOTYwqX2UT6GE_2a1LDjVc4b_nymI0'
    search_engine_ID = '013044299581177508447:irovpa3a1yo'
    tbm = 'nws'
    url = 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1'

    params = {
            'key': api_key,
            'cx': search_engine_ID,
            'tbm': tbm,
            'q': name.encode('utf-8')
            }
    data = urllib.parse.urlencode(params)
    full_url = url + '?' + data
    response = urllib.request.urlopen(full_url)
    result = json.load(response)
    ans['news'] = []
    for item in result['items']:
        ans['news'].append((item['title'], item['link']))
    return ans 
```
which get response from recognition module as input, return the new list from Google Search API.

2. Finally we implemented it:

### Development of Web Interface and deloyment to EC2
A simple web APP built with NodeJS, express, and Formidable. Uploading image throuth AJAX And call API, which is built in the previous part.

It is not the main module of project so detail of development is omitted.
