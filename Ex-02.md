# Idea
We use Rekognition and S3 and Lambda  
We refer to [this site](https://recipe.kc-cloud.jp/archives/9110)  

First, we upload an picture to S3.  
Then, Lambda start to connect to Rekognition and recognize a person in the picture using Celebrity Recognition.
Rekognition returns JSON that includes the name of the person in the picture.  
Finnaly, we search news of the person with google, Yahoo, or other search engines, and we get a list of news titles and URLs.
